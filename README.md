# Report Findings
After completing this project, I did an inspection of the resulting columns after using describe function on the student_df. I have noticed that the values of the mean and fifty percentiles were very similar or close to each other. This has led me to believe that there were no outliars and our data cleaning went well after performing the removing of duplicates and NaN rows. The maximum and min values all the columns seems to be in range of what it should be and no outliars are found.
